First bag: micro prisms, gate->leica relative offset, gate->gate as robot 0
Second bag: mini prisms, gate->leica relative offset again, seemingly more variance on prism, gate->gate more zero than before
Third bag: leica node restarted, mini prisms, much worse roll offset user error, didn't switch to using mini prisms (was this the problem at edgar?) after fixing same results as above
Fourth bag: moved leica, rotated "black line origin marker" to face 90deg left, still mini prisms, still consistently wrong roll and pitch, different yaw (obv)
Fifth bag: move leica, levelled "base" of leica (tripod portion, not top portion), used micro for all on accident instead of mini, same results
Sixth bag: move lieca, closer to base, use micro on accident again, first tf better (first noticable change) 
Seventh bag: move leica, further from base than original position, mini prisms used, better tf, same as sixth bag though, still not flat
Eight bag: micro prisms, distant leica, way worse pitch and roll on gate (sadge)
Ninth bag: micro prisms, just code restart for both leica and prism gui, same results, seems smaller prisms matter more at distance
